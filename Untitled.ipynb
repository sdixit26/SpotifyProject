JSON files including Userdata.json, Payments.json, Identity.json, Identifiers.json, Followers.json, and DuoNewFamily.json all included information about my account, the email linked to it, my user data, and information about the Spotify Family plan I'm in with a couple of my friends. I will not be exploring these files in this project as they contain personal information."

    "- YourLibrary.json which includes a list of all the tracks in my library\n",
    "\n",
    "- SearchQueries.json which includes a list of all the search queries I've made and on which platform\n",
    "\n",
    "- Inferences.json which is essentially a list of assumptions Spotify has made about me as a consumer by observing my interactions. It's divided into 1p, 2p, 3p to denote whether the information is something they directly discovered (1p) or gathered from a third party affiliate (3p) This is, in my opinion the most intriguing file, although my analysis will focus on streaming history and library data."
